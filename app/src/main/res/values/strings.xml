    <string name="pisces_storyTitle">Tides of Love and Terror</string>
    <string name="aries_storyContent">Long ago, in the kingdom of Boeotia, a cruel famine gripped the land. In desperation, King Athamas believed he had to sacrifice his children, Phrixus and Helle, to appease the gods. But the gods, merciful to the innocent, sent a radiant, golden ram with wings that shimmered like the sun.\n\nThe ram swept down from the skies and carried the children upon its back, soaring above oceans and kingdoms. As they fled, Helle lost her grip and fell into the sea, which mournfully took her life and became known forever as the Hellespont. Phrixus, grieving yet alive, reached Colchis safely. In gratitude, he sacrificed the ram to Zeus and hung its golden fleece in a sacred grove—later the prize of Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nZeus, honored by the ram’s valor, placed its spirit among the stars as Aries. It lives on as the first sign of the zodiac, a symbol of heroic rescue, courage, and the divine will to protect the innocent.</string>
    <string name="taurus_storyContent">Europa, a Phoenician princess with unmatched beauty, once wandered along the shore, laughing with her handmaidens. Zeus saw her and fell in love instantly. To approach her without fear, he transformed into a stunning white bull with horns like crescent moons and eyes calm as a summer sea.\n\nEuropa was enchanted. The bull knelt before her, and she climbed upon its back. Without warning, the bull leapt into the ocean and swam toward Crete, carrying her away from the mortal world. There, Zeus revealed his true form and made Europa queen of Crete. Their union birthed legends and kings.\n\nTo commemorate this act of divine love and strength, Zeus placed the image of the bull in the night sky. Now Taurus roams the heavens, a guardian of passion, earthbound grace, and irresistible power.</string>
    <string name="gemini_storyContent">Castor and Pollux, the inseparable twins, were born of the same mother, Leda, but with different fathers—one mortal, one divine. Castor was the skilled horseman, and Pollux the unmatched boxer. They stood side by side in every battle and every voyage, even joining Jason and the Argonauts on their heroic quest.\n\nBut fate struck cruelly when Castor was fatally wounded in combat. Pollux, devastated, refused to live without him. He begged Zeus to take his immortality and give it to his brother. Zeus, moved by such devotion, allowed them to share it—spending half their time in Olympus and half in the underworld.\n\nTo honor their eternal love and sacrifice, Zeus placed them in the sky as Gemini—the Twin Stars. Together they shine, a celestial reminder that no force, not even death, can break true brotherhood.</string>
    <string name="cancer_storyContent">As Heracles battled the many-headed Hydra in the swamps of Lerna, Hera, ever his enemy, sent a giant crab to aid the monster. Though small compared to the Hydra, the crab scuttled into battle without hesitation, snapping at Heracles\' heels with fierce loyalty.\n\nHeracles crushed it underfoot, barely noticing its brave defiance. But the gods did. Hera, touched by the crab’s courage in the face of certain death, placed it in the sky as Cancer.\n\nThough it lost the battle, the crab won a place in eternity. Cancer now crawls among the stars, a symbol of devotion, quiet strength, and the idea that even the smallest act of bravery can echo through the cosmos.</string>
    <string name="leo_storyContent">In the dark forests of Nemea roamed a lion of terrifying size, born of monsters and immune to all weapons. It devoured soldiers, terrified villages, and crushed bones like twigs. As part of his Twelve Labors, Heracles was sent to kill it.\n\nAfter arrows and swords failed, Heracles blocked its cave and wrestled the beast with bare hands. The struggle shook the trees and rumbled through the mountains. Finally, Heracles strangled it, and its spirit ascended to the stars.\n\nZeus honored the lion’s unmatched strength and noble death by placing it in the heavens as Leo. Its fierce eyes still blaze in the night sky, a symbol of royalty, strength, and the will to conquer what seems impossible.</string>
    <string name="virgo_storyContent">Demeter, goddess of the harvest, wandered the Earth with joy, blessing fields with abundance. But her joy shattered when Hades, lord of the underworld, abducted her daughter Persephone. In her anguish, Demeter caused the world to wilt—plants died, waters receded, and life faded.\n\nThe gods begged her to restore nature, but she refused until her daughter was returned. At last, a deal was struck—Persephone would spend part of the year above and part below. This created the seasons.\n\nThough balance returned, Demeter’s grief never fully healed. She rose to the stars, becoming Virgo, the maiden. She watches over us still, a goddess of growth and sorrow, whispering that from pain, new life always blooms.</string>
    <string name="libra_storyContent">Astraea, the last immortal to walk among mortals, carried golden scales that could weigh the hearts of men. She lived among humanity during the Golden Age, when peace reigned. But as humans grew violent and corrupt, Astraea wept and fled from the Earth.\n\nDisillusioned, she soared into the heavens and took her place among the stars. Her scales remained—forever weighing truth against deception.\n\nAs Libra, she watches from the skies, reminding mortals of the justice they once knew. Her constellation is the only zodiac sign represented by an object, not a creature—symbolizing balance, order, and the ever-watchful eye of divine judgment.</string>
    <string name="scorpio_storyContent">Orion, a mighty hunter, once boasted that he could kill every beast on Earth. His arrogance angered Gaia, the Earth Mother, who unleashed a giant scorpion to humble him. The scorpion’s sting was deadly, and Orion fell.\n\nImpressed by the power of both, Zeus placed them in the sky—but on opposite ends. When Orion rises, Scorpio sinks, and vice versa. They chase each other forever, never touching, locked in an eternal cycle of pride and punishment.\n\nScorpio now slithers across the stars as a dark symbol of vengeance, retribution, and the cosmic price of unchecked pride.</string>
    <string name="sagittarius_storyContent">Chiron, the kindest and wisest of all centaurs, trained heroes like Achilles and Hercules. Though immortal, he was accidentally wounded by Heracles with a poisoned arrow. The pain was unbearable—and incurable, even by his own skilled hands.\n\nRather than suffer forever, Chiron chose to surrender his immortality to free the Titan Prometheus. Touched by this act, Zeus placed Chiron among the stars as Sagittarius.\n\nNow, the archer gallops across the night sky, his bow always drawn, a symbol of healing, knowledge, and the willingness to sacrifice for the good of others.</string>
    <string name="capricorn_storyContent">When the monstrous Typhon attacked Olympus, the gods fled in fear. Pan, god of the wild, leapt into a river to escape, transforming into a sea-goat—half goat, half fish.\n\nThough the other gods eventually defeated Typhon, Pan’s quick thinking and strange transformation impressed Zeus. To honor this moment of clever survival, he placed Pan in the stars as Capricorn.\n\nThe sea-goat now climbs the cosmic mountains, representing endurance, adaptability, and the spirit that rises even from chaos.</string>
    <string name="aquarius_storyContent">Ganymede, a beautiful prince of Troy, caught the eye of Zeus, who brought him to Olympus to serve as cupbearer to the gods.
